# Data Structure and Algorithms Excercises (Python)

# How to use:
1.  Open any file.
2.  Remove the contents of all classes, except XxxTest class, which contains the testcases.
3.  Implement the functions needed by the Data Structure/Algorithm.
4.  Run `python filename.py` to run the testcases.

If you are using VSCode, install `Python Test Explorer` extension, to get a  nice sidebar 
containing all the tests in all the files.

# Why Python, why not C/C++ ?
Python lets me ignore the issues like memory management and segfaults,
while focusing on understanding how the data structure or algorithm works.

Python also has a very nice test framework builtin.

It also gives me a traceback to the line causing the error, if an error occurs.
